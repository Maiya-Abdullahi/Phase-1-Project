# Introduction

The company is expanding into aviation to operate airplanes for commercial and private use. To support this, the project analyzes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023, sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board, covering civil aviation incidents in the U.S. and international waters. The aim is to assess safety risks and operational factors to provide actionable insights, helping the aviation division select aircraft models that align with safety and business goals.

# Business Problem

The company is venturing into the aviation industry to operate airplanes for both commercial and private enterprises but lacks expertise in assessing aircraft risks. To ensure a safe and successful entry into this industry, the company faces the following challenges:

## Safety Risk Assessment
Evaluate historical accident and incident data to analyze the frequency and severity of aviation events, helping identify low-risk aircraft models.
Geographical and Temporal Analysis
Understand the spatial and temporal distribution of aviation events to pinpoint high-risk regions and timeframes for safer operations.
Event Type and Investigation Insights
Examine the distribution of accidents versus incidents and the associated investigation levels to uncover operational risks and areas requiring additional focus.
The objective is to deliver a data-driven analysis to inform aircraft selection and operational strategies, ensuring safety and reducing risks in the company's new aviation venture.

## 1. Data understanding
The dataset, sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board, provides detailed records of aviation accidents and incidents from 1962 to 2023. It covers events in the United States and international waters, offering a reliable basis for analyzing safety risks and operational factors in the aviation industry.
