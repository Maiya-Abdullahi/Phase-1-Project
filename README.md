# Phase-1-Project
# Introduction

The company is expanding into aviation to operate airplanes for commercial and private use. To support this, the project analyzes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023, sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board, covering civil aviation incidents in the U.S. and international waters. The aim is to assess safety risks and operational factors to provide actionable insights, helping the aviation division select aircraft models that align with safety and business goals.
